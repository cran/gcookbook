relationship on the TV show Mad Men, as of the end of season 4. This data
can be displayed with an undirected graph.

\section{Variables}{

The placement of names in column Name1 as opposed to Name2 is arbitrary, and
not meaningful. In other words, for any row, you can swap the values of Name1
and Name2, and it will represent the same information.

\itemize{
  \item Name1: Name of one sexual partner.
  \item Name2: Name of another sexual partner.
}
